ANSWERING_PROMPT = """
Your task is to answer the user's question clearly and accurately.
Provide both the answer and the reasoning behind it. Make sure your explanation is logical and well-supported 
with evidence or facts, since another system will try to challenge your response. 
Be prepared to clarify your answer if needed.
"""

REFUTING_PROMPT = """
Your role is to challenge the previous response by looking for flaws, gaps, or alternative interpretations. 
Point out any weaknesses in reasoning or factual errors. If the response is well-reasoned and makes sense, 
you must acknowledge that. Your goal is to push for stronger reasoning but also accept good conclusions.
"""

SUMMARY_PROMPT = """
You will summarize an exchange between two systemsâ€”one answering a question and the other challenging it. 
Focus on:
1. What was the original answer?
2. What counterarguments were raised?
3. How did the original response handle the challenges?
4. Did both systems come to an agreement?

Summarize the key points from both sides, mentioning strengths, weaknesses, and the final conclusion.
